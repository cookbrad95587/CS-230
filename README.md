# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is "The Gaming Room". They wanted us to take their application, which at the time was only designed to run on Android, and design it to run on a distributed system. They wanted us to evaluate three different operating platforms: Linux, Mac and Windows. The game would have the abiltiy to have one ore more teams, each witl multiple users. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I did particularly well in documenting the requirements of the application to the client. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
What I found helpful in working through a design document is that it allowed for me to organize my thoughts in a way that the client could understand. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part to revise, it would be laying out the differences in the operating platforms and what made one better than the other.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented the user's needs by taking into consideration security and availability of the application. The client wanted to be able to run this application on multiple users' devices at once, so I recomended the use of geo diversity. I also recomended Linux as the operating platform as this is the most secure platform.
